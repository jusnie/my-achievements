        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="myphoto.jpg" alt="My Photo" class="profile-pic">
        <p>Hi, i'm <strong>Juanie Cuenca</strong> a student at Gen. T. Deleon National High School passionate about technology, innovation, and leadership.</p>

<p>i started learning programming and Arduino projects during the pandemic which led me to explore web development and artificial intelligence chatbots. back in Grade 9 (2023), i developed an AI chatbot which i later sold to a US-based company due to the high cost of maintaining domain.</p>

<p>currently as a Grade 11 student i am developing our school website, which will be integrated with an AI assistant. This platform aims to help students and parents with online school registration providing a more convenient alternative to walk-in applications.</p>

<p>additionally, I am working on GenDance an RFID-based attendance system that will track student attendance and notify teachers if students leave during class hours if i win the election, i plan to fully implement these tech innovations to modernize our school.</p>

<p>as a tech-driven leader, my goal is to make technology more accessible, improve student engagement and create a more connected and innovative school environment.</p>
